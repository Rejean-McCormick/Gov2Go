# Gov2Go Backend

The Gov2Go backend is a microservice-based architecture designed to handle scalable, secure, and efficient government services. Key components include the API Gateway, various microservices, and a central database.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gov2go/backend.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copier le code
npm install
Set up environment variables:

bash
Copier le code
cp .env.example .env
Start the development server:

bash
Copier le code
npm run dev
Dependencies
Node.js >= 14.0.0
Redis
MongoDB
Docker (optional, for containerized environments)
Environment Configuration
The application requires specific environment variables to run. Refer to the .env.example file for required settings such as database URLs, Redis configuration, and API keys.

Usage Examples
Below are some example API calls that can be made to the Gov2Go backend.

Get Users
bash
Copier le code
curl -X GET https://api.gov2go.com/users -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
Create a New User
bash
Copier le code
curl -X POST https://api.gov2go.com/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'
Project Structure
bash
Copier le code
/backend
├── api-gateway/
├── core/
├── devops/

└── services/
Each directory contains different parts of the backend system:

api-gateway/: Handles all incoming API requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.
core/: Core functionality, including authentication, authorization, and shared utilities.
devops/: Infrastructure and deployment configurations, including Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
docs/: Project documentation, including API docs and architecture diagrams.
services/: Microservices handling different business logic, such as user management, notifications, and more.
